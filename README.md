Step 2:

Reverted my rogue code from Step 1.  It was cleaner, but did not expose the deduction rules as the internal DSL does.

Created tests around the internal DSL


Step 0:

Pulled code from the book http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Scala-Scalability-Functional-Objects/dp/0596155956/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1381962239&sr=8-4&keywords=dean+wampler

...I presume this is fair use.  I claim no copyright on this code.

I got the code to compile and the API test to run green as a scalatest

Commented out the internal DSL test
